Webapp helps you organizing your photos into folders (Draft)

## Problem

Photo storage on my [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) works as follows.
Files from several devices get uploaded to my NAS, especially from smartphones and cameras.
They all end up unsorted in several inbox-like folders.

Then, I sort them out.
Photos from events get their own folder.
Photos from our cats, our flat, couple pictures or rather artistic photos get their own folder, but grouped by year and month.
Finally, photos from our child are of such a high number, that I only keep the best (again, grouped by his age -- in weeks, month or years), and put the other ones further away in ZIP files or another subfolder.

I find this process to be important, however, the tool support is bad.
I open my laptop, go through all new images using a gallery viewer, and `Ctrl+X` / `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` them into the appropriate target folder, having multiple Windows Explorer instances open.
That's complicated and slow.
Also, I can only do that at home, as I don't want to make my NAS to be accessible from the internet.

What would an appropriate tool look like?
